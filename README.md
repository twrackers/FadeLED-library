# FadeLED-library
This Arduino library uses the [StateMachine library](https://github.com/twrackers/StateMachine-library) to control Arduino PWM outputs, to allow LEDs to be turned on and off with settable ramp-on and ramp-off times.

More details can be found [here](https://github.com/twrackers/FadeLED-library/blob/master/libraries/FadeLED/README.md).
